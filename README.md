# Single-Page-Application

This repository is used for a project in CISC Web Development. This assignment is to creates a single page application about crimes in St. Paul. It will use at least 3 APIs to retrieve data - Leaflet (Links to an external site.), Nominatim (Links to an external site.), and an API from Project 3. This application should be interactive, responsive, and allow a user to investigate crimes from various St. Paul neighborhoods. This project will also incorporate Vue JS (Links to an external site.) as a framework to make building the app simpler. This project also has a second web page - "About the project", which will document the team, the development process, and demo the final application with interesting findings. For this project, we are free to use other JavaScript or CSS libraries as we see fit.
